What happens if the inputs are given different name attributes?
Change these inputs so that multiple answers are allowed to be selected.
Create a dropdown that asks the user what web browser they are using.

As you work through the steps above, you should:

Make sure all of your form elements have labels.
Make sure there's a way to submit the form, adding a submit button will solve this.
Ensure that all of your form values are being submitted to the Request Inspector.
Experiment with different attribute values:
What do you notice when changing the form's request method from GET to POST?
What happens if you leave off the name attribute on an input?
What happens if you leave off the id attribute on a form input?
Finally, commit the changes to your git repository, and push to GitHub.
Bonus
To configure your forms to send you an email, sign up for the free plan on El
Formo. El Formo will provide you a URL for your form's action attribute. When
you use this action, the El Formo service will email you each form submission.
This is a great way to get forms working online super quick!
